You are asking about the effect of running the command `git rebase -i 3248590cd`. This command initiates an **interactive rebase** starting from the commit immediately following `3248590cd` up to the current `HEAD`. Interactive rebasing allows you to modify commit history by editing, reordering, squashing, or removing commits.

**Key Points**:

- **Commit Range**: The rebase affects commits from the child of `3248590cd` to the current `HEAD`.

- **Interactive Mode**: The `-i` flag opens an editor displaying a list of these commits, where you can specify actions for each.

**Common Actions During Interactive Rebase**:

- `pick`: Use the commit as is.

- `reword`: Use the commit but edit its message.

- `edit`: Pause to amend the commit.

- `squash`: Combine this commit with the previous one.

- `fixup`: Like `squash` but discard this commit's message.

- `exec`: Run a shell command.

**Example Scenario**:

Assume the commit history is:

```
A---B---C---D---E---F---G (HEAD)
```

Running `git rebase -i C` affects commits `D`, `E`, `F`, and `G`.

**Process**:

1. **Editor Opens**: Lists commits `D` to `G` with `pick` by default.

2. **Specify Actions**: Modify the list to change commit messages, reorder commits, squash commits, etc.

3. **Save and Exit**: Git applies the specified actions, pausing if manual intervention is needed (e.g., resolving conflicts).

**Important Considerations**:

- **Rewriting History**: Interactive rebase rewrites commit history; avoid using it on shared branches to prevent issues for collaborators.

- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts may arise during rebasing; resolve them and continue with `git rebase --continue`.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Git documentation on rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).

    Update README with detailed git rebase tutorial
    
    The README file has been significantly expanded to include a comprehensive tutorial on using the 'git rebase' command effectively. It covers editing old commit messages, deleting unwanted commits, combining multiple commits, and provides safety precautions about using 'git rebase'.

Yes, your statement is correct.

When you run the command:

```bash
git rebase -i 3248590cd
```

It **will affect** the following commits from your `git log` output:

1. `064c79cf9d72d6c6bd4100436bd0141019043337`  
2. `42e96a7c9c5900233c0a0b611227a67635b3590c`  
3. `d43edb741395a0819be53f3b31cb55a757f895ea`  
4. `a18e1f3e2e95b191e8da7413a2a611c8460d58bf`  
5. `136a18f829a972c79e85f188e5f083c8fedea745`  

However, **commit `3248590cd963d04618f734383c6d98db2a177132` itself** is not included in the rebase. The rebase begins **from the child of `3248590cd`** and includes all commits up to the current `HEAD`.

Your understanding of the command's effect is correct!
